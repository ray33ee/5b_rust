- For a given input display all possible conversions. Allow the user to change the input to one of these conversions.
  - This allows an arbitrary number of conversions without having to keep entering data and identifying it
- ToIR implementations:
  - AScii/unicode string
    - AScii/unicode character  
  - All possible bases (using BaseCrack API)
  - Python string formatted bytes list
  - DateTime (Variants: all common RFC formats, custom format)
  - IpV4, IpV6 (variant: optional 16-bit port)
  - GUID
  - Html colours
  - List of bytes (hex or decimal formatted)
  - Disassembly (16, 32 and 64-bit)
- FromIR implementations:
  - AScii/unicode string
    - AScii/unicode character
  - All possible bases (using BaseCrack API)
  - Python string formatted bytes list
  - DateTime
  - IpV4, IpV6
  - GUID
  - All combinations of signed/unsigned 8, 16, 32, 64 and 128 bit integers
  - Colours
  - List of bytes (hex or decimal formatted)
  - Disassembly (16, 32 and 64-bit)
- Throw in a nice looking ascii table for good measure  
- Modify the Base2_16 to allow variants for lower and upper case formatting
  - This will only affect `FromIR` since `ToIR` will accept a mix of upper and lower case
  - Should this be a variant? It's not really different enough to be a variant.
    - It should be separate from a variant
    - add 'Options' argument to FromIR that allows user to specify formatting.
      - This is distinct from variants, variants treat the IR differently, whereas Options all treat the IR the same way, they just format it into a string differently
