- For a given input display all possible conversions. Allow the user to change the input to one of these conversions.
  - This allows an arbitrary number of conversions without having to keep entering data and identifying it
- ToIR implementations:
  - All possible bases (using BaseCrack API)
  - Python string formatted bytes list
  - GUID
  - Html colours
  - List of bytes (decimal formatted)
  - File path (load bytes from file)
- FromIR implementations:
  - All possible bases (using BaseCrack API)
  - Python string formatted bytes list
  - GUID
  - Colours
  - List of bytes (decimal formatted)
  - Disassembly (16, 32 and 64-bit)
  - File path (save bytes from file)
- Throw in a nice looking ascii table for good measure  
- Modify the Base2_16 to allow variants for lower and upper case formatting
  - This will only affect `FromIR` since `ToIR` will accept a mix of upper and lower case
  - Should this be a variant? It's not really different enough to be a variant.
    - It should be separate from a variant
    - add 'Options' argument to FromIR that allows user to specify formatting.
      - This is distinct from variants, variants treat the IR differently, whereas Options all treat the IR the same way, they just format it into a string differently
- Create a single FixedInteger struct that represents signed/unsigned 8, 16, 32, 64 and 128 bit numbers (format as decimals)  
- Big/little endian-nes should be selected by reversing the IR
